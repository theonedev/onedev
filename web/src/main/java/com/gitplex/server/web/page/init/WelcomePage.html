		GitPlex uses the organization concept to organize users, teams and repositories 
		in a central place to facilitate collaboration and permission management. 
		We suggest to <a wicket:id="addOrganization">create an organization</a> 
		to host shared repositories.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You can also <a wicket:id="addDepot">add repository</a> into your own account
		now, and transfer it into an organization later if necessary.
