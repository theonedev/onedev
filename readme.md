Being an open source product does not mean that features of OneDev are compromised compared to other commercial products. Instead it has many benefits:

### Symbol Search and Navigation

Language aware symbol search. Symbol navigation in source code and diff. Outline display and search. Works for every commit. Currently supports Java, JavaScript, C, C++, CSharp, Go, PHP, Python, CSS, SCSS, LESS and R.

### Code Discussions and Comprehensions

Code discussions on arbitrary block of source code or diff. Discussions stay with the code to help code comprehension even if file is changed or renamed. This also works for code discussions made in pull requests.
