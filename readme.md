### Flexible Build Workflow and Pipeline

Conditional build parameters. Create matrix builds by combining values of different parameters. Connect jobs to create pipelines via dependencies. Run massive job pods concurrently to speed up processing. Manual approval of certain jobs with role based control.

### Custom Issue States and Fields

Add custom issue states and fields. Appearance or value of issue field can be defined to be dependent on value of other fields. Define manual state transition rules with permission control, or auto transition rules when certain events happen.

### Flexible Pull Request Review Policies

Enforce pull request review under certain conditions with branch protections. Specify required reviewers and builds for desired file patterns.

### Powerful Query Language

A powerful query language is available to execute sophisticated queries against projects, commits, builds, issues, pull requests or code comments, with auto suggestions and completions everywhere. Query can be saved for quick access later, and can be subscribed to get notified of interesting events.

### Deep Integration of Code, Issue, Pull Request and Build

Configure issue to transit to desired state upon particular commit, build or pull request events. See commit and pull request events in issue activities. Query fixed issues between two builds. Query builds or pull requests fixing specified issues.

### Fine Grained Permission Control

Define permission schemes best suiting your development workflow. For instance, you may specify who can change particular source folder, who can assign issues, who can run release builds, or who can access build log, etc.
