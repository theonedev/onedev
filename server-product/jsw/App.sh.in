# Java Service Wrapper sh script.  Suitable for starting and stopping
#  wrapped Java applications on UNIX platforms.
# Optimized for use with version 3.5.44-st of the Wrapper.
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These settings can be modified to fit the needs of your application

# IMPORTANT - Please always stop and uninstall an application before making
#             any changes to this file.  Failure to do so could remove the
#             script's ability to control the application.

# NOTE - After loading the variables below, the script will attempt to locate a
#  file with the same basename as this script and having a '.shconf' extension.
#  If such file exists, it will be executed giving the user a chance to
#  override the default settings. Having the customized configuration in a
#  separate '.shconf' file makes it easier to upgrade the Wrapper, as the
#  present script file can then be replaced with minimal changes (although at
#  least the 'INIT INFO' below needs to be updated).

# Initialization block for the install_initd and remove_initd scripts used by
#  SUSE linux, CentOS and RHEL distributions.  Also used by update-rc.d.
# Note: From CentOS 6, make sure the BEGIN INIT INFO section is before any line 
#       of code otherwise the service won't be displayed in the Service 
#       Configuration GUI.
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: @app.name@
# Required-Start: $remote_fs $syslog
# Should-Start: $network $time
# Should-Stop: $network $time
# Required-Stop: $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 1 6
# Short-Description: @app.long.name@
# Description: @app.description@
### END INIT INFO

# Application name and long name: If these variables are not set (or left to
#  the default tokens), APP_NAME will default to the name of the script, then
#  APP_LONG_NAME will default to the value of APP_NAME.
APP_NAME="@app.name@"
APP_LONG_NAME="@app.long.name@"

# If uncommented (and set to false), APP_NAME and APP_LONG_NAME will no longer 
#  be passed to the wrapper. See documentation for details.

# Priority at which to run the wrapper.  See "man nice" for valid priorities.
#  nice is only used if a priority is specified.
PRIORITY=

# Location of the pid file.
PIDDIR="../status"

# PIDFILE_CHECK_PID tells the script to double check whether the pid in the pid
#  file actually exists and belongs to this application.  When not set, only
#  check the pid, but not what it is.  This is only needed when multiple
#  applications need to share the same pid file.
PIDFILE_CHECK_PID=true

# FIXED_COMMAND tells the script to use a hard coded action rather than
#  expecting the first parameter of the command line to be the command.
#  By default the command will be expected to be the first parameter.
@set_fixed_command@

# PASS_THROUGH controls how the script arguments should be passed to the
#  Wrapper. Possible values are:
#  - commented or 'false': the arguments will be ignored (not passed).
#  - 'app_args' or 'true': the arguments will be passed through the Wrapper as
#                          arguments for the Java Application.
#  - 'both': both Wrapper properties and Application arguments can be passed to
#            the Wrapper. The Wrapper properties come in first position. The
#            user can optionally add a '--' separator followed by application
#            arguments.
# NOTE - If FIXED_COMMAND is set to true the above applies to all arguments,
#        otherwise it applies to arguments starting with the second.
# NOTE - Passing arguments is only valid with the following commands:
#          - 'console'
#          - 'start', 'restart', 'condrestart' (if not installed as a daemon)
@set_pass_through@

# If uncommented, causes the Wrapper to be shutdown using an anchor file.
#  When launched with the 'start' command, it will also ignore all INT and
#  TERM signals.
#IGNORE_SIGNALS=true

# Wrapper will start the JVM asynchronously. Your application may have some
#  initialization tasks and it may be desirable to wait a few seconds
#  before returning.  For example, to delay the invocation of following
#  startup scripts.  Setting WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP to a positive number will
#  cause the start command to delay for the indicated period of time 
#  (in seconds).
WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP=0

# If set, wait for the wrapper to report that the daemon has started
WAIT_FOR_STARTED_STATUS=true
WAIT_FOR_STARTED_TIMEOUT=120

# If set, the status, start_msg and stop_msg commands will print out detailed
#   state information on the Wrapper and Java processes.
#DETAIL_STATUS=true

# If set, the 'pause' and 'resume' commands will be enabled.  These make it
#  possible to pause the JVM or Java application without completely stopping
#  the Wrapper.  See the wrapper.pausable and wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm
#  properties for more information.
#PAUSABLE=true

# Set the mode used to 'pause' or 'resume' the Wrapper. Possible values are
#  'signals' which uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, and 'file' which uses the command
#  file to communicate these actions.  The default value is 'signals'.
#  Be aware that depending on the mode, the properties wrapper.signal.mode.usr1,
#  wrapper.signal.mode.usr2, or wrapper.commandfile of the configuration file may
#  be overriden.
#PAUSABLE_MODE=signals

# If specified, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.
# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write
#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log
#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error
#  message.
# NOTE - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as
#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or
#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.
#RUN_AS_USER=

# Set the full path to the 'su' command (substitute user).
# NOTE - In case 'su' is not in the PATH, you can set the absolute path here,
#  for example:
#  SU_BIN=/bin/su
# NOTE - For Red Hat, the script will use '/sbin/runuser' if it is present and 
#  ignore the value of SU_BIN.
SU_BIN=su

# Set option(s) for 'su' or 'runuser'.
# In case the user set in RUN_AS_USER has no bash set, the 'su' command will fail.
# The workaround for GNU/Linux system is to specify which bash to use with 
#  the '-s' option.
#SU_OPTS="-s /bin/bash"

# By default we show a detailed usage block.  Uncomment to show brief usage.
#BRIEF_USAGE=true

# Set which service management tool to use.
# Possible values are: 
#   for linux...: auto, systemd, upstart, initd
#   for aix.....: auto, src, initd
# When set to 'auto', this script file will try to detect in the order of the 
# list for each platform which service management tool to use to install the Wrapper.
SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_TOOL=auto

# Specify how the Wrapper daemon and its child processes should be killed
#  when using systemd.
#  The default is 'control-group' which tells systemd to kill all child
#  processes (including detached ones) in the control group of the daemon
#  when it stops.
#  Alternatively, 'process' can be specified to prevent systemd from
#  killing the child processes leaving this responsibility to the Wrapper.
#  In this case child processes marked as 'detached' will not be killed on shutdown.
# NOTE - the daemon must be reinstalled for any changes on this property to take effect.
SYSTEMD_KILLMODE=control-group

# When installing on Mac OSX platforms, the following domain will be used to
#  prefix the plist file name.
PLIST_DOMAIN=org.tanukisoftware.wrapper

#  is to be kept continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the 
#  invocation.

# Set run level to use when installing the application to start and stop on
#  system startup and shutdown.  It is important that the application always
#  be uninstalled before making any changes to the run levels.
# It is also possible to specify different run levels based on the individual
#  platform.  When doing so this script will look for defined run levels in
#  the following order:
#   1) "RUN_LEVEL_S_$DIST_OS" or "RUN_LEVEL_K_$DIST_OS", where "$DIST_OS" is
#      the value of DIST_OS.  "RUN_LEVEL_S_solaris=20" for example.
#   2) RUN_LEVEL_S or RUN_LEVEL_K, to specify specify start or stop run levels.
#   3) RUN_LEVEL, to specify a general run level.
